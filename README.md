# TinkerKeyer
A morse code keyer based on the TinkerKit LCD hardware platform.

The TinkerKit LCD module is currently available on Amazon.com at a very reasonable cost, and it provides an Arduino Leonardo compatible CPU along with an LCD display.

The first step is to reprogram the bootloader on the TinkerKit LCD with a stock bootloader for an Arduino Leonardo.
